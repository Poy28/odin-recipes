    <p>You can make this super-delicious Filipino coconut garlic fried rice (sinangag) recipe mostly ahead of time because you need the steamed rice to cool and dry out a bit before you fry it. The final result is irresistible and goes with everything on this menu, so I like to make two batches — one plain and one with the optional turmeric — which adds a little extra flavor and a pretty orange color.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup uncooked jasmine rice</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ (15 ounce) can unsweetened coconut cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric (Optional)</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons coconut oil</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place rice in a large bowl with enough water to cover by a few inches; swirl with your fingers, then drain. Repeat until water runs clear, about 3 times. </li>
        <li>Combine rice, 1 ½ cups water, coconut cream, turmeric, and salt in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Chill, uncovered, 2 to 4 hours to overnight. </li>
        <li>Heat coconut oil in a 12-inch skillet or wok over high heat. Add garlic; cook until it just begins to brown, about 1 minute. Add rice and spread in an even layer; cook, without stirring, until lightly browned and crisp on the bottom, about 4 minutes. Add fish sauce; cook, stirring, until fully combined and heated through, about 2 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
